Activity Tracing

Block-based activity tracing once:
```
_ = UNTracingActivity.initiate("Activity") {
	// ... os_log stuff
}
```
Activity tracing for multiple blocks:
```
let activity: UNTracingActivity? = UNTracingActivity("Activity")
_ = UNTracingActivity.apply(activity) {
	// ... os_log stuff
}
```
Scope-based activity tracing:
```
let activity: UNTracingActivity? = UNTracingActivity("Activity2")
var scope = activity?.enter()
// ... os_log stuff
defer {
	scope?.leave()
}
```
